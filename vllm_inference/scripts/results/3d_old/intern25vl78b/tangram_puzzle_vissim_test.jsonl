Rotating it by 30 degrees means it will not align with the grid cells properly, making it impossible to place it correctly on the 4x4 grid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that piece A cannot be placed correctly after a 30-degree rotation, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

Placing it at (1, 3) would fit within the grid, covering the top-middle and top-right squares.\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece D by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece D is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (0, 1) with a 60-degree rotation would not fit within the grid because it would extend beyond the grid boundaries.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, Step 1 and Step 5 involve placing pieces in positions that would extend beyond the grid boundaries. Therefore, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces as described in the steps.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

After rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes a 2x1 rectangle.\n   - Placing it at (0, 3) means it will cover the cells (0, 3) and (0, 2).\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece D by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 rectangle. After rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes a 1x2 rectangle.\n   - Placing it at (0, 2) means it will cover the cells (0, 2) and (1, 2).\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece B by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 3).**\n   - Piece B is a 1x1 square. Rotating it 30 degrees clockwise doesn't change its shape.\n   - Placing it at (2, 3) means it will cover the cell (2, 3).\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece C by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 1x2 rectangle.

let's follow the steps provided and see if all pieces fit within the 4x4 grid without overlapping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Step 1: Rotate piece B by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 3x1 rectangle. Placing it at (1, 4) with a 30-degree rotation means it will span from (1, 4) to (3, 4) horizontally.\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece E by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (3, 3).**\n   - Piece E is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (3, 3) with a 60-degree rotation means it will fit within the grid without overlapping with piece B.\n\n3. **Step 3: Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (1, 3) means it will span from (1, 3) to (2, 3) horizontally.\n\n4. **Step 4: Place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 2).**\n   - Piece F is a 1x2 rectangle. Placing it at (1, 2) means it will span from (1, 2) to (1, 3) vertically.\n\n5. **Step 5: Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (0, 4) means it will fit within the grid without overlapping with other pieces.\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece G by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece G with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 2).**\n   - Piece G is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (2, 2) with a 90-degree rotation means it will span from (2, 2) to (3, 3) horizontally and vertically.\n\n7. **Step 7: Rotate piece H by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece H with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece H is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (0, 1) with a 30-degree rotation means it will fit within the grid without overlapping with other pieces.\n\n8. **Step 8: Rotate piece C by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 1x2 rectangle. Placing it at (0, 3) with a 60-degree rotation means it will span from (0, 3) to (1, 3) horizontally.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter following all the steps, it appears that all pieces can be placed within the 4x4 grid without overlapping.

Rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise will make it fit into a 1x3 space.\n   - Placing it at (0, 4) means it will occupy the cells (0, 4), (1, 4), and (2, 4).\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece B by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 2x1 rectangle. Rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise will make it fit into a 1x2 space.\n   - Placing it at (1, 4) means it will occupy the cells (1, 4) and (2, 4).\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece C by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 4).**\n   - Piece C is a 2x2 square. Rotating it by 30 degrees clockwise will not change its size.\n   - Placing it at (2, 4) means it will occupy the cells (2, 4), (3, 4), (2, 3), and (3, 3).\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece F by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 1).**\n   - Piece F is a 1x2 rectangle. Rotating it by 90 degrees clockwise will make it fit into a 2x1 space.\n   - Placing it at (2, 1) means it will occupy the cells (2, 1) and (3, 1).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The placement of pieces D, E, A, B, and C does not overlap and fits within the 4x4 grid.\n- Piece F, however, cannot be placed at (2, 1) without overlapping with piece D, which is already placed at (1, 2) to (3, 2).\n\nTherefore, the Tangram puzzle **cannot** be completed with the available pieces as described.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

Placing it at (0, 1) means it will cover the cells (0, 1) and (1, 1).\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece C by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (4, 2).**\n   - Piece C is a 1x3 rectangle. After rotating it 60 degrees clockwise, it will not fit into the 4x4 grid properly because it will not align with the grid lines.\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece B by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 2x2 square. After rotating it 30 degrees clockwise, it will not fit into the 4x4 grid properly because it will not align with the grid lines.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe steps provided involve rotating pieces C and B by 60 and 30 degrees respectively, which will not align them properly with the grid lines of the 4x4 Tangram board. Therefore, the puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces as described.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

Placing it at (0, 4) means it will cover the top-left corner of the 4x4 board.\n   - After rotating it by 60 degrees, it will not fit perfectly into the grid since the rotation will cause it to overlap or extend beyond the grid lines.\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece C by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece C is also a 2x2 square. Placing it at (0, 2) means it will cover the middle-left part of the board.\n   - Rotating it by 30 degrees will similarly cause it to not fit perfectly into the grid.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece D by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 2).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (2, 2) means it will cover the center of the board.\n   - Rotating it by 90 degrees will not change its size or shape, but it will still not fit perfectly into the grid due to the rotation.\n\n4. **Step 4: Place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 4x1 rectangle. Placing it at (2, 4) means it will cover the top-right part of the board.\n   - Since piece B is a rectangle and not a square, it will not fit into the 2x2 spaces left by the other pieces.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the rotations and placements described, the pieces will not fit perfectly into the 4x4 grid due to the rotations causing misalignment with the grid lines.

steps and the placement of each piece to determine if the Tangram puzzle can be completed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Step 1: Rotate piece C by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (0, 3) means it will cover the cells (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), and (1, 4).\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece E by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (3, 3).**\n   - Piece E is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (3, 3) means it will cover the cell (3, 3).\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece B by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 3x1 rectangle. Placing it at (1, 4) means it will cover the cells (1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 4).\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece H by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece H with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece H is a 3x1 rectangle. Placing it at (0, 1) means it will cover the cells (0, 1), (1, 1), and (2, 1).\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece G by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece G with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (3, 2).**\n   - Piece G is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (3, 2) means it will cover the cells (3, 2) and (3, 3).\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece F by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 2).**\n   - Piece F is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (2, 2) means it will cover the cells (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 3).\n\n7. **Step 7: Rotate piece A by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (0, 4) means it will cover the cell (0, 4).\n\n8. **Step 8: Rotate piece D by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (2, 3) means it will cover the cells (2, 3) and (3, 3).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The placement of pieces C, E, B, H, G, F, A, and D as described in the steps results in overlapping and gaps in the 4x4 grid.\n- Specifically, pieces F and G overlap at cell (3, 3), and there are gaps in the grid that are not filled by any piece.\n\nTherefore, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces as described in the steps.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

Place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (1, 4).**\n   - Piece E is a square, so rotating it 90 degrees clockwise doesn't change its shape. Placing it at (1, 4) fits perfectly in the top-right corner of the board.\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece C by about 90 degrees clockwise. Place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a rectangle. Rotating it 90 degrees clockwise changes its orientation. Placing it at (0, 3) fits perfectly in the left-middle section of the board.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece F by about 30 degrees clockwise. Place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (2, 4).**\n   - Piece F is a parallelogram. Rotating it 30 degrees clockwise changes its orientation. Placing it at (2, 4) fits perfectly in the top-right section of the board, next to piece E.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece D by about 30 degrees clockwise. Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece D is a triangle. Rotating it 30 degrees clockwise changes its orientation. Placing it at (0, 4) fits perfectly in the top-left section of the board, next to piece C.\n\n5. **Step 5: Place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (2, 3).**\n   - Piece B is a square. Placing it at (2, 3) fits perfectly in the middle-right section of the board, next to piece F.\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece A by about 60 degrees clockwise. Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece A is a parallelogram. Rotating it 60 degrees clockwise changes its orientation. Placing it at (0, 2) fits perfectly in the bottom-left section of the board, next to piece D.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter following all the steps, all the pieces fit perfectly into the 4x4 Tangram board without any overlaps or gaps.

(x, y) = (2, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 2x1 rectangle.

Rotating it by 60 degrees clockwise and placing it at (2, 3) would not fit properly because a square cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece A by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 2x2 square. Rotating it by 30 degrees clockwise and placing it at (0, 4) would not fit properly because a square cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece F by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 1).**\n   - Piece F is a 1x1 square. Rotating it by 60 degrees clockwise and placing it at (1, 1) would not fit properly because a square cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece D by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 rectangle. Rotating it by 60 degrees clockwise and placing it at (0, 2) would not fit properly because a rectangle cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece E by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 2).**\n   - Piece E is a 1x1 square. Rotating it by 60 degrees clockwise and placing it at (1, 2) would not fit properly because a square cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n7. **Step 7: Rotate piece G by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece G with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 1).**\n   - Piece G is a 2x1 rectangle.

Analysis:\n\n1. **Step 1: Rotate piece C by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (2, 3) means it will cover the cells (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), and (3, 4).\n\n2. **Step 2: Place piece H with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 1).**\n   - Piece H is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (2, 1) means it will cover the cells (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece B by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (2, 4) means it will cover the cells (2, 4) and (3, 4). However, this overlaps with piece C from Step 1.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece A by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (0, 4) means it will cover the cells (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), and (1, 5). However, the board is only 4x4, so this placement is invalid.\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece E by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece E is a 1x2 rectangle. Placing it at (0, 2) means it will cover the cells (0, 2) and (1, 2).\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece G by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece G with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 1).**\n   - Piece G is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (1, 1) means it will cover the cell (1, 1).\n\n7. **Step 7: Rotate piece F by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece F is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (0, 1) means it will cover the cell (0, 1).\n\n8. **Step 8: Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (3, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (3, 3) means it will cover the cells (3, 3) and (3, 4). However, this overlaps with piece C from Step 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Steps 3 and 8 involve overlapping placements with piece C.\n- Step 4 involves placing a piece outside the bounds of the 4x4 board.\n\nGiven these issues, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces as described in the steps.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

Placing it at (2, 3) means it will cover the cells from (2, 3) to (3, 4).\n\n### Step 2: Rotate piece E by about 60 degrees clockwise. Place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (2, 4).\n- Piece E is a 2x1 rectangle. After rotating it by 60 degrees, it will not fit perfectly into the grid, as the grid is composed of square cells. This step is problematic because the rotated piece E will not align with the grid cells.\n\n### Step 3: Rotate piece A by about 30 degrees clockwise. Flip piece A vertically.

Placing it at (0, 1) means it will occupy the bottom-left part of the board, overlapping with pieces D and H.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis, it is clear that several pieces overlap with each other when placed according to the given steps. Specifically, pieces C, F, E, and G overlap with other pieces, making it impossible to fit all pieces within the 4x4 board without overlapping.\n\nTherefore, the Tangram puzzle **cannot** be completed with the available pieces based on the given steps.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

corner at (x, y) = (2, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (2, 4) means it will occupy the cells (2, 4) and (3, 4).\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece C by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 2x2 square. Rotating it by 60 degrees clockwise and placing it at (2, 3) would not fit properly because a square cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece A by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 2x2 square. Rotating it by 30 degrees clockwise and placing it at (0, 4) would not fit properly because a square cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece F by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 1).**\n   - Piece F is a 1x1 square. Rotating it by 60 degrees clockwise and placing it at (1, 1) would not fit properly because a square cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece D by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 rectangle. Rotating it by 60 degrees clockwise and placing it at (0, 2) would not fit properly because a rectangle cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece E by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 2).**\n   - Piece E is a 1x1 square. Rotating it by 60 degrees clockwise and placing it at (1, 2) would not fit properly because a square cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n7. **Step 7: Rotate piece G by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece G with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 1).**\n   - Piece G is a 2x1 rectangle. Rotating it by 30 degrees clockwise and placing it at (2, 1) would not fit properly because a rectangle cannot be rotated to fit into a 2x1 space.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe steps provided involve rotating pieces by 30 or 60 degrees, which is not possible for the given shapes (squares and rectangles).

Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Step 1: Rotate piece C by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (2, 3) means it will cover the cells (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), and (3, 4).\n\n2. **Step 2: Place piece H with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 1).**\n   - Piece H is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (2, 1) means it will cover the cells (2, 1) and (2, 2).\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece B by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (2, 4) means it will cover the cells (2, 4) and (2, 5). However, this placement conflicts with the placement of piece C in Step 1, which already occupies (2, 4).\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece A by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (0, 4) means it will cover the cells (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), and (1, 5).\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece E by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece E is a 1x2 rectangle. Placing it at (0, 2) means it will cover the cells (0, 2) and (0, 3).\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece G by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece G with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 1).**\n   - Piece G is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (1, 1) means it will cover the cell (1, 1).\n\n7. **Step 7: Rotate piece F by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece F is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (0, 1) means it will cover the cell (0, 1).\n\n8. **Step 8: Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (3, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (3, 3) means it will cover the cells (3, 3) and (3, 4).\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The placement of piece B in Step 3 conflicts with the placement of piece C in Step 1, as both pieces would occupy the cell (2, 4).\n- Therefore, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the given steps and available pieces.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

Placing it at (3, 3) with a 60-degree rotation would not fit within the 4x4 grid.\n\n3. **Step 3: Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 rectangle. Placing it at (1, 3) would fit within the 4x4 grid.\n\n4. **Step 4: Place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 2).**\n   - Piece F is a 1x2 rectangle. Placing it at (1, 2) would fit within the 4x4 grid.\n\n5. **Step 5: Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (0, 4) would fit within the 4x4 grid.\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece G by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece G with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 2).**\n   - Piece G is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (2, 2) with a 90-degree rotation would not fit within the 4x4 grid.\n\n7. **Step 7: Rotate piece H by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece H with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece H is a 1x1 square. Placing it at (0, 1) with a 30-degree rotation would not fit within the 4x4 grid.\n\n8. **Step 8: Rotate piece C by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 1x2 rectangle. Placing it at (0, 3) with a 60-degree rotation would not fit within the 4x4 grid.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, several steps involve rotations that would not fit the pieces within the 4x4 grid. Therefore, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces as described in the steps.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (1, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a square. Rotating it by 60 degrees doesn't change its shape, but it will not fit perfectly into the grid due to the rotation. This step seems problematic because a square rotated by 60 degrees will not align with the grid lines.\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece B by about 90 degrees clockwise. Place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (3, 1).**\n   - Piece B is a small square. Rotating it by 90 degrees doesn't change its shape, and it can fit into the grid at the specified coordinates.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece E by about 30 degrees clockwise.

Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (1, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a square. Rotating it by 60 degrees doesn't change its shape, but it will not fit perfectly into the grid due to the rotation. This step seems problematic because a square rotated by 60 degrees will not align with the grid lines.\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece B by about 90 degrees clockwise. Place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (3, 1).**\n   - Piece B is a square. Rotating it by 90 degrees will still keep it as a square, and it can fit into the grid. This step is feasible.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece E by about 30 degrees clockwise. Place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (3, 2).**\n   - Piece E is a triangle. Rotating it by 30 degrees will not align it with the grid lines, making it difficult to fit perfectly.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece A by about 30 degrees clockwise. Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece A is a rectangle. Rotating it by 30 degrees will not align it with the grid lines, making it difficult to fit perfectly.\n\n5. **Step 5: Place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece F is an L-shaped piece. Placing it without rotation should be feasible if the space is available.\n\n6. **Step 6: Place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a rectangle. Placing it without rotation should be feasible if the space is available.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Steps 1, 3, and 4 involve rotating pieces by angles that do not align with the grid lines, making it impossible to fit these pieces perfectly into the grid.\n- Steps 2, 5, and 6 are feasible as they involve placing pieces without problematic rotations.\n\nGiven the issues with Steps 1, 3, and 4, the Tangram puzzle **cannot** be completed with the available pieces as described.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 3x1 piece. Placing it at (1, 4) with a 30-degree rotation means it will span from (1, 4) to (3, 4) horizontally.\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece E by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (3, 3).**\n   - Piece E is a 1x1 piece. Placing it at (3, 3) with a 60-degree rotation means it will fit within the grid at (3, 3).\n\n3. **Step 3: Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x1 piece. Placing it at (1, 3) means it will span from (1, 3) to (2, 3) horizontally.\n\n4. **Step 4: Place piece F with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 2).**\n   - Piece F is a 1x2 piece. Placing it at (1, 2) means it will span from (1, 2) to (1, 3) vertically.\n\n5. **Step 5: Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 1x1 piece. Placing it at (0, 4) means it will fit within the grid at (0, 4).\n\n6. **Step 6: Rotate piece G by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece G with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 2).**\n   - Piece G is a 2x2 piece. Placing it at (2, 2) with a 90-degree rotation means it will span from (2, 2) to (3, 3) horizontally and vertically.\n\n7. **Step 7: Rotate piece H by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece H with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece H is a 1x1 piece. Placing it at (0, 1) with a 30-degree rotation means it will fit within the grid at (0, 1).\n\n8. **Step 8: Rotate piece C by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 1x2 piece. Placing it at (0, 3) with a 60-degree rotation means it will span from (0, 3) to (1, 3) horizontally.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy following the steps, we can see that all pieces fit within the 4x4 grid without overlapping or going out of bounds. Therefore, the Tangram puzzle can be completed with the available pieces.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}"}

Place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (2, 3).\n\n- Piece C is a square. Rotating it by 30 degrees will not change its size or shape, but it will not fit perfectly into the grid since the grid is made of squares and rectangles. This step seems problematic because a rotated square won't align with the grid lines.\n\n### Step 2: Rotate piece B by about 30 degrees clockwise. Flip piece B vertically. Place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 3).\n\n- Piece B is an L-shaped piece. Rotating and flipping it will change its orientation, but it still needs to fit within the grid. Given the L-shape, it's unlikely to fit perfectly into the grid after such transformations.\n\n### Step 3: Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (1, 2).\n\n- Piece A is a 2x2 square. Placing it at (1, 2) would cover the cells from (1, 2) to (2, 3). However, this placement conflicts with the placement of piece C in Step 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the transformations and placements described, it is not possible to complete the Tangram puzzle with the available pieces as specified. The rotations and placements do not align with the grid structure, and there are conflicts in the placement of pieces.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\text{No}}."}
