Place it with its upper-left corner at (2, 3).\n\n### Step 2: Rotate piece B by 60 degrees clockwise and flip it vertically\nPiece B is a L-shaped piece. When rotated 60 degrees clockwise, it becomes a different shape. When flipped vertically, it becomes another shape. Place it with its upper-left corner at (0, 4).\n\nNow, let's try to fit these pieces on the 4x4 grid:\n\n1. **Piece A (2x2 square) at (2, 3):**\n   - This piece will cover the top-right corner of the grid.\n\n2. **Piece B (L-shaped piece) at (0, 4):**\n   - This piece will cover the bottom-right corner of the grid.\n\nWith these two pieces, we have covered the top-right and bottom-right corners of the grid. However, we still need to cover the remaining area of the grid.\n\n### Remaining Area:\n- The remaining area is a 2x2 square in the top-left corner.\n- We need to place another piece to cover this remaining area.\n\n### Possible Solution:\n- Place piece A (2x2 square) at (1, 1) to cover the remaining 2x2 square in the top-left corner.\n\n### Final Check:\n- Piece A at (2, 3) covers the top-right corner.\n- Piece A at (1, 1) covers the top-left corner.\n- Piece B at (0, 4) covers the bottom-right corner.\n\nAll pieces fit perfectly on the 4x4 grid, completing the Tangram puzzle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{\\text{Yes}}\\)."}
