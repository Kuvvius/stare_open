Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece A is a parallelogram, and rotating it 60 degrees clockwise will make it a parallelogram with a specific orientation. Placing it at (0, 1) will cover the bottom-left 2x2 square of the 3x3 board.\n\nAfter these steps, the board looks like this:\n- The top-left 2x2 square is covered by piece C.\n- The top-right 2x2 square is covered by piece B.\n- The bottom-left 2x2 square is covered by piece A.\n\nThis leaves the bottom-right 1x1 square uncovered. Since there are no remaining pieces (A, B, or C) that can fit into this 1x1 square, the puzzle cannot be completed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{No}."}

The exact placement and rotation of a 3x3 square at a 30-degree angle is complex and typically not straightforward to fit into a 4x4 grid without leaving gaps or overlapping.\n\nGiven the above steps and the constraints of the 4x4 grid, it is not possible to place piece B in the specified manner without leaving gaps or overlapping. Therefore, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces.\n\n\\boxed{No}"}

Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece A is a parallelogram, and rotating it 60 degrees clockwise means it will be oriented such that its upper-left corner is at (0, 1). This means the piece will be placed horizontally, with its upper-left corner at (0, 1).\n\nNow, let's visualize the placement:\n- Piece C is at (0, 3) and (1, 3).\n- Piece B is at (1, 3) and (2, 3).\n- Piece A is at (0, 1) and (0, 2).\n\nThe board is a 3x3 grid, and the pieces are placed as follows:\n- C covers the top row (0, 3) and (1, 3).\n- B covers the rightmost column (1, 3) and (2, 3).\n- A covers the bottom-left corner (0, 1) and (0, 2).\n\nThe remaining space in the board is:\n- (0, 2) to (0, 3) (leftmost column, bottom row).\n- (1, 2) to (1, 3) (middle column, bottom row).\n- (2, 2) to (2, 3) (rightmost column, bottom row).\n\nSince the pieces C, B, and A cover the entire board, there is no space left for any additional pieces. Therefore, the Tangram puzzle can be completed with the available pieces.\n\n\\boxed{Yes}"}

Placing it with its upper-left corner at (2, 4) means it spans from (2, 4) to (2, 3).\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece C by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 3).**\n   - Piece C is a 2x2 piece. When rotated 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes a 2x1 piece.

When rotated 30 degrees clockwise, it does not fit neatly into the grid as a 2x2 piece would. This suggests that the rotation might not be possible or the placement might not fit the grid correctly.\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece D by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece D is a 1x2 piece.

This suggests that the rotation of piece A by 30 degrees clockwise is not feasible or the placement is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces as described.\n\n\\boxed{No}"}

The upper-left corner of the rotated piece D will be at (2, 1).\n\nNow, let's check if the board is completely covered by these pieces:\n- The board is a 3x3 grid, so it has 9 cells.\n- After placing the pieces as described, we need to count the cells covered:\n  - Piece C covers 4 cells.\n  - Piece A covers 3 cells.\n  - Piece B covers 2 cells.\n  - Piece D covers 1 cell.\n\nAdding these up: \\(4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\\) cells, which is more than the 9 cells in the 3x3 grid.\n\nSince the total number of cells covered by the pieces exceeds the number of cells in the 3x3 grid, it is not possible to complete the Tangram puzzle with the available pieces.\n\n\\boxed{No}"}

This means there are 3 unit squares left uncovered on the 4x4 board.\n\nSince the puzzle requires covering all 16 unit squares on the 4x4 board, and we have only covered 13, it is not possible to complete the Tangram puzzle with the available pieces.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

Place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (3, 4).**\n   - Piece C is a 2x1 rectangle. After rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes a 1x2 rectangle. Placing it with its upper-left corner at (3, 4) covers the top-right 2x2 square.\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece D by about 90 degrees clockwise. Place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 3).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x2 square. After rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes a 2x2 square. Placing it with its upper-left corner at (0, 3) covers the top-left 2x2 square.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece B by about 90 degrees clockwise. Flip piece B vertically. Place piece B with its lower-left corner at (x,y) = (1, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 2x2 square. After rotating it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes a 2x2 square. Flipping it vertically means it is now a 2x2 square with its lower-left corner at (1, 4). This covers the top-left 2x2 square, but it overlaps with piece D.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece E by about 30 degrees clockwise. Place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece E is a 2x1 rectangle. After rotating it 30 degrees clockwise, it becomes a parallelogram. Placing it with its upper-left corner at (0, 4) covers the top-left 2x1 rectangle, but it overlaps with piece D.\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece A by about 60 degrees clockwise. Place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x,y) = (0, 1).**\n   - Piece A is a 2x1 triangle. After rotating it 60 degrees clockwise, it becomes a parallelogram. Placing it with its upper-left corner at (0, 1) covers the bottom-left 2x1 rectangle, but it overlaps with piece D.\n\nFrom the above steps, it is clear that the placement of piece B and piece E overlaps with piece D, and the placement of piece A overlaps with piece D.

The upper-left corner at (1, 2) means the piece will extend from (1, 2) to (2, 2) horizontally and from (1, 2) to (1, 1) vertically.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece B by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 3).**\n   - Piece B is a 1x2 rectangle. When rotated by 60 degrees clockwise, it will cover part of the board. The upper-left corner at (1, 3) means the piece will extend from (1, 3) to (2, 3) horizontally and from (1, 3) to (1, 2) vertically.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece A by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 3).**\n   - Piece A is a 2x2 square. When rotated by 60 degrees clockwise, it will cover part of the board. The upper-left corner at (0, 3) means the piece will extend from (0, 3) to (1, 3) horizontally and from (0, 3) to (0, 2) vertically.\n\nNow, let's visualize the placement of each piece:\n- Piece C covers the area from (0, 2) to (1, 2) vertically and from (0, 2) to (0, 1) horizontally.\n- Piece D covers the area from (1, 2) to (2, 2) horizontally and from (1, 2) to (1, 1) vertically.\n- Piece B covers the area from (1, 3) to (2, 3) horizontally and from (1, 3) to (1, 2) vertically.\n- Piece A covers the area from (0, 3) to (1, 3) horizontally and from (0, 3) to (0, 2) vertically.\n\nWhen we place these pieces, we can see that the board is completely covered without any gaps or overlaps. Therefore, the Tangram puzzle can be completed with the available pieces.\n\n\\boxed{Yes}"}
