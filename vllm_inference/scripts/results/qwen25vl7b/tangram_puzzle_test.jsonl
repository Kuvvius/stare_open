When rotated by 30 degrees, it will cover a portion of the board. The upper-left corner of the rotated piece C will be at (2, 2).\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece B by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece B is a 2x2 square. When rotated by 60 degrees, it will cover a portion of the board. The upper-left corner of the rotated piece B will be at (0, 2).\n\nNow, let's visualize the placement of these pieces on the 3x3 board:\n\n- **Piece A (3x1, rotated by 30 degrees)**: The upper-left corner is at (1, 2). This piece will cover a vertical strip from (1, 2) to (1, 3).\n- **Piece C (1x2, rotated by 30 degrees)**: The upper-left corner is at (2, 2). This piece will cover a horizontal strip from (2, 2) to (3, 2).\n- **Piece B (2x2, rotated by 60 degrees)**: The upper-left corner is at (0, 2). This piece will cover a diagonal strip from (0, 2) to (2, 4).\n\nWhen we place these pieces on the board, we need to check if the entire board is covered without any gaps or overlaps.\n\n- The piece A will cover the vertical strip from (1, 2) to (1, 3).\n- The piece C will cover the horizontal strip from (2, 2) to (3, 2).\n- The piece B will cover a diagonal strip from (0, 2) to (2, 4).\n\nHowever, the piece B will extend beyond the boundaries of the 3x3 board, specifically the right edge at (2, 4). This means that the piece B cannot be placed as described because it will extend beyond the board's boundaries.\n\nTherefore, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces as described.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

The upper-left corner at (0, 3) means the piece will be placed in the top-left corner of the board.\n   - This placement is possible as it fits within the 3x3 board.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece D by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 2).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x2 square. When rotated 60 degrees clockwise, it will form a parallelogram. The upper-left corner at (1, 2) means the piece will be placed in the middle-right area of the board.\n   - This placement is possible as it fits within the 3x3 board.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece C by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece C with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece C is a 1x2 rectangle. When rotated 60 degrees clockwise, it becomes a 2x1 rectangle. The upper-left corner at (0, 2) means the piece will be placed in the middle-left area of the board.\n   - This placement is possible as it fits within the 3x3 board.\n\nAfter placing all the pieces according to the given steps, we need to check if the entire 3x3 board is covered without any gaps or overlaps.\n\n- The upper-right corner is covered by piece B.\n- The top-left corner is covered by piece A.\n- The middle-right area is covered by piece D.\n- The middle-left area is covered by piece C.\n\nSince all the pieces fit within the 3x3 board and there are no gaps or overlaps, the Tangram puzzle can be completed.\n\n\\boxed{Yes}"}

Placing it with its upper-left corner at (0, 2) means the bottom-right corner will be at (1, 0). This placement covers the bottom-left quadrant of the board.\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece A by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 2).**\n   - Piece A is a 2x2 square. Placing it with its upper-left corner at (0, 2) means the bottom-right corner will be at (2, 0). This placement covers the bottom-left quadrant of the board, but it overlaps with piece C.\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece E by about 60 degrees clockwise, and place piece E with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 2).**\n   - Piece E is a 2x2 square. Placing it with its upper-left corner at (2, 2) means the bottom-right corner will be at (4, 0). This placement covers the bottom-right quadrant of the board.\n\n5. **Step 5: Rotate piece D by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (1, 2).**\n   - Piece D is a 1x2 rectangle. Placing it with its upper-left corner at (1, 2) means the bottom-right corner will be at (2, 0). This placement covers the bottom-left quadrant of the board, but it overlaps with piece C and piece A.\n\nAfter following these steps, we see that pieces C and A overlap, and pieces D and A overlap. This means the puzzle cannot be completed without overlapping pieces.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{No}."}

The standard Tangram pieces do not allow for such overlapping without violating the rules of the puzzle.\n\nTherefore, the Tangram puzzle cannot be completed with the available pieces based on the given steps.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{No}}"}

When rotated 60 degrees clockwise, it will cover part of the board starting from (0, 2). The upper-left corner of the rotated piece will be at (0, 2), and the piece will extend to (2, 4).\n\n2. **Step 2: Rotate piece D by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece D with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (2, 2).**\n   - Piece D is a 2x2 square. When rotated 30 degrees clockwise, it will cover part of the board starting from (2, 2). The upper-left corner of the rotated piece will be at (2, 2), and the piece will extend to (4, 4).\n\n3. **Step 3: Rotate piece B by about 30 degrees clockwise, and place piece B with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (3, 4).**\n   - Piece B is a 1x2 rectangle. When rotated 30 degrees clockwise, it will cover part of the board starting from (3, 4). The upper-left corner of the rotated piece will be at (3, 4), and the piece will extend to (4, 4).\n\n4. **Step 4: Rotate piece A by about 90 degrees clockwise, and place piece A with its upper-left corner at (x, y) = (0, 4).**\n   - Piece A is a 2x3 rectangle. When rotated 90 degrees clockwise, it will cover part of the board starting from (0, 4). The upper-left corner of the rotated piece will be at (0, 4), and the piece will extend to (2, 4).\n\nNow, let's check if the board is completely covered:\n- The board is a 4x4 grid, so it has 16 squares.\n- Piece C covers 4 squares from (0, 2) to (2, 4).\n- Piece D covers 4 squares from (2, 2) to (4, 4).\n- Piece B covers 2 squares from (3, 4) to (4, 4).\n- Piece A covers 4 squares from (0, 4) to (2, 4).\n\nAdding these up:\n- C: 4 squares\n- D: 4 squares\n- B: 2 squares\n- A: 4 squares\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 14 squares\n\nSince the board has 16 squares and we have covered 14 squares, there is a missing square.
