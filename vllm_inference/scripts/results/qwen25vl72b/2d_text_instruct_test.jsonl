The only change is the position of the circle relative to the reference point (the origin).\n\n3. **Effect of Rotation**: Since the circle is symmetric, rotating it by 30 degrees counter-clockwise will still result in a circle. The only difference will be the position of the circle relative to the origin, but the shape itself remains a circle.\n\n4. **Comparison with Options**: \n   - Option (A) shows a circle, which is the same shape as the initial circle.\n   - Option (B) shows an ellipse, which is not a circle.\n   - Option (C) shows a smaller circle, which is not the same size as the initial circle.\n   - Option (D) shows a line segment, which is not a circle.\n\nSince the only change is the position of the circle and not its shape, the correct answer is the option that shows a circle of the same size as the initial circle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}."}

This matches the transformation described.\n- **Option (B)**: The square is shifted to the right, but it is not rotated. This also matches the transformation described.\n- **Option (C)**: The square is much smaller and shifted to the right. This does not match the transformation described because the size of the square should remain the same.\n- **Option (D)**: The square is rotated and shifted to the right. This does not match the transformation described because the square should not be rotated.\n\nSince both options (A) and (B) show the square shifted to the right without any rotation, and they are identical in this context, we can choose either one. However, typically in such problems, the first correct option is chosen.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}"}

It is a right triangle with a 90-degree angle at the bottom left, a 60-degree angle at the top, and a 30-degree angle at the bottom right. The black dot indicates the center of rotation.\n\n2. **Understand the Rotation**: A 30-degree counter-clockwise rotation means that each point of the triangle will move 30 degrees in the counter-clockwise direction around the center of rotation (the black dot).\n\n3. **Visualize the Rotation**: If we rotate the triangle 30 degrees counter-clockwise, the right angle will move from the bottom left to a position that is 30 degrees counter-clockwise from its original position. The 60-degree angle will move to a position that is 30 degrees counter-clockwise from its original position, and the 30-degree angle will move to a position that is 30 degrees counter-clockwise from its original position.\n\n4. **Compare with the Options**:\n   - Option (A) shows a very small triangle, which is not the result of a 30-degree rotation of the original triangle.\n   - Option (C) shows a triangle that is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise, which is too much rotation.\n   - Option (D) shows a triangle that is rotated 30 degrees counter-clockwise, which matches our visualization.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\)."}

This matches the described transformation.\n\n- **Option (D)**: This shape is an elongated oval that is oriented horizontally. It does not resemble a circle that has been shifted left and slightly upward. Therefore, this is not the correct option.\n\nBased on the analysis, the shape that best represents the final result after the described transformations is option (C).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\)."}

So, rotating the circle by -60 degrees clockwise is the same as rotating it by 60 degrees counter-clockwise.

For simplicity, let's assume it is oriented such that one of its sides is horizontal.\n\n### Step 2: Rotate the Hexagon by -90 Degrees Clockwise\nRotating a hexagon by -90 degrees clockwise (which is the same as 270 degrees counterclockwise) will change its orientation. If we start with a hexagon where one side is horizontal, after a -90 degree rotation, the side that was horizontal will now be vertical and pointing downwards.\n\n### Step 3: Rotate the Hexagon by -30 Degrees Clockwise\nNext, we rotate the hexagon by -30 degrees clockwise. This is a smaller rotation, so the hexagon will be slightly rotated further from its previous position. The side that was vertical and pointing downwards will now be tilted slightly to the right.\n\n### Step 4: Reduce the Size of the Hexagon\nFinally, we reduce the size of the hexagon, making it smaller. This means the hexagon will be a smaller version of its previous orientation.\n\n### Analyzing the Options\n- **Option A**: This is a large green hexagon with a black dot in the center. It does not match the smaller size requirement.\n- **Option B**: This is a small green hexagon with a black dot in the center. The hexagon is smaller, but its orientation does not match the -120 degree rotation (it looks like it is not rotated at all or very little).\n- **Option C**: This is a large brown hexagon with a black dot in the center.
