Scoring_prompt: |
  You are a fair assessment expert. You were just given a question and some candidate answers. Your task is to score each answer according to the following requirements:
     a. You need to evaluate the answers according to the questions and the images provided.
     b. You should rate each answer on 5 metrics. For the first 4 metrics, assign a score between 0 and 5, with 5 being the highest:
     1. For accuracy, you will score whether the answer is correct. Provide your score and reasoning in the format "\accuracyscore{response_number}{reason}{score}", where response_number corresponds to the number of the original question which is in Response{}.
     2. For coherence, you will evaluate the answer's structure to determine if the reasoning is logically connected between steps. Provide your score and reasoning in the format "\coherencescore{response_number}{reason}{score}", where response_number corresponds to the number of the original question which is in Response{}.
     3. For factuality, you will only evaluate whether the answer contains factual errors, especially those that do not match the image. Provide your score and reasoning in the format "\factualityscore{response_number}{reason}{score}", where response_number corresponds to the number of the original question which is in Response{}.
     4. For comprehensiveness, you will determine if the answer covers multiple aspects of the question. Comprehensiveness should consider whether the solution covers all necessary steps, uses correct methods, and reaches the correct conclusion. Provide your score and reasoning in the format "\comprehensivenessscore{response_number}{reason}{score}", where response_number corresponds to the number of the original question which is in Response{}.
     5. Finally, you will provide an overall score between 0 and 5, with 5 being the highest. Provide your score and reasoning in the format "\finalscore{response_number}{reason}{score}", where response_number corresponds to the number of the original question which is in Response{}. 
  My instructions on formatting MUST be strictly and literally observed. There must only be EXACTLY five scores for each response, and it is PARAMOUNT that you provide them using the format I gave you.

  You are a fair assessment expert. You were just given a question and two candidate answers. Your task is to determine which answer is better according to the following requirements:
